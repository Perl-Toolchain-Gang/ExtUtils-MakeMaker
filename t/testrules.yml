# TAP::Harness test rules
# "t\02-xsdynamic.t" (and possibly "t\03-xsstatic.t") should *not* be run in parallel
# ... allowing overlap of these tests causes race conditions which lead to intermittent failures
seq:
  - seq:
    # serialize all tests in files matching "t/0*.t"
    - t{\\,/}0*.t
  - par:
    # run all other tests in parallel
