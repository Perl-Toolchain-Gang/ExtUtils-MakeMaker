Fix prefixify to use $(PREFIX) instead of cut & pasting the prefix
directly into the Makefile.

Add INSTALLDIRS=vendor (see Debian patch)

Shorten manifypods so it fits in < 200 character command line (like
pm_to_blib).

Cleanup manifypods so it uses Pod::Man instead of pod2man.

Test MM_Any and pull some redundant tests out of MM_*.t

Create a way to init MM objects.

Move instmodsh to utils/ in the core.

Handle config files (ie. /etc) and their special PREFIX needs
(ie. PREFIX=/usr, INSTALLCONFIGDIR=/etc).

Test that bogus Makefile.PL's cause warnings.

Test that bogus hint files cause warnings.

Test that Makefile.PL's are run in package main.
