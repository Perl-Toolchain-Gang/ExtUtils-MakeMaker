Fix INSTALLMAN*DIR to honor PREFIX.

Make the libs honor PREFIX.

Don't assume everything is in $Config{PREFIX}/lib and
$Config{PREFIX}/man.  Debian puts stuff in /usr/share/{perl,man}

Add SITEPREFIX

Fix prefixify to use $(PREFIX) instead of cut & pasting the prefix
directly into the Makefile.

Add INSTALLDIRS=vendor (see Debian patch)

Shorten manifypods so it fits in < 200 character command line (like
pm_to_blib).

Cleanup manifypods so it uses Pod::Man instead of pod2man.

Rethink MM_Win32 tests.

Investigate one method per make target.

Test MM_Any and pull some redundant tests out of MM_*.t

MakeMaker's warnhandler has to go away.

Create a way to init MM objects.

Move instmodsh to utils/ in the core.

Handle config files (ie. /etc) and their special PREFIX needs
(ie. PREFIX=/usr, INSTALLCONFIGDIR=/etc).

Fix Win32 when perl is installed in C:\Program Files

Make sure PDL builds

Fix find_perl on Amiga trg@privat.utfors.se

Support full recursive scans of Makefile.PL's.  Not just a shallow
one-level peek.

Add a way to explicitly skip certain directories from processing.
