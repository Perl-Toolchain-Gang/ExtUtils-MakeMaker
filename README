This is a CPAN distribution of the venerable MakeMaker module.  It has been
backported to work with Perl 5.6.0 and up.

Please note that while this module works on Perl 5.6, it is no longer
being routinely tested on 5.6. However, patches to repair any breakage
on 5.6 are still being accepted.

See INSTALL for installation instructions.  Run "perldoc
ExtUtils::MakeMaker" (while in this source directory before
installation) for more documentation.

See http://rt.cpan.org or
https://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang/ExtUtils-MakeMaker/issues
for a full list of open problems.

Please report your bugs via http://rt.cpan.org or

by mailing to makemaker@perl.org.
  
RT or GitHub are preferred.
